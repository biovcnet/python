## What is Pandas (Python Data Analysis library)?


* A library developed for handling multi-dimensional data sets, which are stored as DataFrame python objects

* Lots of built-in functions developed for sorting, filtering and cleaning large, complex data sets 

* HUGE time saver! Can sometimes do in 1-2 lines of code what normally would require a whole loop of code

* DataFrames are still compatible with other python library functions
