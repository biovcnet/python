## What is Pandas (Python Data Analysis library)?


* A library developed for handling multi-dimensional data sets, which are stored as DataFrame python objects

* Lots of built-in functions developed for sorting, filtering and cleaning large, complex data sets 

* HUGE time saver! Can sometimes do in 1-2 lines of code what normally would require a whole loop of code

* DataFrames are still compatible with other python library functions

## The DataFrame Structure

Pandas DataFrames are organized in to rows and columns, much like a Numbers or Excel spreadsheet. 

The rows and columns can be referred to by their python zero-based indices, or by their user-defined identifiers (column names for columns and indices for rows). 

If the user does not specify a data column to use as indices for rows or does not have column headers, Pandas will assign the numerical indices.
