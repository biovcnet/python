# Python Lesson 9: 

## Ordinations I - Jaccard and Bray-Curtis beta diversity analyses

### What are alpha and beta diversity?

Metrics are used in bioinformatics to broadly answer:

- how species-rich or species-uniform is a sample -**alpha diversity**
- how different is the microbial composition in one environment or sample -**beta diversity**

There are many Alpha and Beta diversity metrics, and it can sometimes be confusing or difficult to determine which is the correct to use to answer your specific research questions.

In this lesson we will be focused on **beta Diversity**. The most commonly used beta diversity metrics include:

- ***Brayâ€“Curtis dissimilarity***:
  - The Bray-Curtis dissimilarity between two samples takes the relative abundances of species into account
  - Ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 meaning the two samples are exactly alike, and 1 meaning they are completely different
