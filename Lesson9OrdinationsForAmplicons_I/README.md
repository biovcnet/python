## Python Lesson 9: 
# Alpha and Beta Diversity
# Ordinations I - Jaccard and Bray-Curtis Beta Diversity analyses

*Alpha Diversity* and *Beta Diversity* metrics are used in bioinformatics to broadly answer the questions *how species-rich or species-uniform is a sample* and *how different is the microbial composition in one environment or sample*, respectively.

There are many Alpha and Beta diversity metrics, and it can sometimes be confusing or difficult to determine which is the correct to use to answer your specific research questions.
