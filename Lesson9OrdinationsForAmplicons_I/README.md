## Python Lesson 9: 
## Alpha and Beta Diversity
## Ordinations I - Jaccard and Bray-Curtis Beta Diversity analyses

#What are Alpha and Beta diversity?

Metrics are used in bioinformatics to broadly answer:

-how species-rich or species-uniform is a sample -**Alpha Diversity**
-how different is the microbial composition in one environment or sample -**Beta Diversity**

There are many Alpha and Beta diversity metrics, and it can sometimes be confusing or difficult to determine which is the correct to use to answer your specific research questions.
